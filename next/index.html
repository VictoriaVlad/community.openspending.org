  <h3>First iteration architecture (MVP)</h3>
  <p>The initial focus within the roadmap was to create a "minimum viable product" version of OpenSpending Next. Primary goals are set out here and in the associated diagram:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide a simple flow for a user to start with a file of spend data and have it visualized in a few of steps</li>
    <li>Provide basic validation of the concepts in OSEP-01</li>
    <li>Provide a good testing ground for iterating on OpenSpending Data Package</li>
    <li>Provide a migration path for all existing data in openspending.org to the new Datastore</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technical Lead</h2>
  <p>
    Adam Kariv is Technical Lead for OpenSpending Next. For any questions, or to participate, feel free to <a href="https://discuss.okfn.org/users/akariv">get in touch directly</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, the OpenSpending Tech Lead Group is a group of developers and domain experts who are helping Open Knowledge International push forward with the new Open Spending roadmap.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tasks the group is involved with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Working through the existing OpenSpending Enhancement Proposals, and making new ones (of course, **anyone** can submit an OSEP, just <a href=" http://labs.openspending.org/osep/">follow the guidelines here</a>)</li>
    <li>Breaking up the general architecture into sets of specific components that individuals or teams can work on</li>
    <li>Synchronising our plans with other spend data projects - it is a complex area, and one we all want to solve well, so we want to do it together</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is **not** a formal committee that has to sign off on every step along the path. Rather, it will be a group that helps bring the existing ideas into fruition, as well as discuss, debate and enhance them. The group will be limited to 5-10 participants.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are interested in taking part, <a href="https://discuss.okfn.org/t/openspending-community-introductions/1145">let us know here</a>, or <a href="https://discuss.okfn.org/users/akariv">contact Adam directly</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Current Tech Lead Group:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Adam Kariv (@akariv) <a href="https://discuss.okfn.org/users/akariv">Profile</a></li>
      <li>Paul Walsh (@pwalsh) <a href="https://discuss.okfn.org/users/pwalsh">Profile</a></li>
      <li>Rufus Pollock (@rgrp) <a href="https://discuss.okfn.org/users/rufuspollock">Profile</a></li>
      
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Enhancement Proposals</h2>
  <p>
    Open Spending Enhancement Proposals (OSEPs) are how we introduce large changes to OpenSpending. Anyone can put forward an enhancement proposal.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://labs.openspending.org/osep/">All OSEPs</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://labs.openspending.org/osep/osep-00.html">OSEP Guidelines</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contributing data</h2>
  <p>
    Upload your data using OS Packager by accessing next.openspending.org/packager/provide-data. Another way to contribute right now is by adding data sources to our <a href="https://github.com/os-data/registry/issues">registry tracker</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Open a new issue</li>
    <li>Write a brief description of the data</li>
    <li>Provide a link to the data (hosted as flat files on GitHub would be best, if possible)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This allows us to look at the data and see how well it fits with our current assumptions. We can then work together on steps to get the data imported into the flat file DataStore.
